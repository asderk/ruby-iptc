Ruby IPTC metadata parser

This library can be used to read the metadata of a jpeg file.
 
It reads the IPTC informations embedded and allows to access this information
Read IPTC::JPEG::Image for more information.

The IPTC library parses the APP13 JPEG Tag and generates a hash of properties for a given file.
